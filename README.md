If you keep seeing the same videos appearing in your suggestions list or want to childproof YouTube so your kids can enjoy it safely, this tutorial is for you. I’m going to show you how to block video suggestions on YouTube and use Restricted Mode to keep your children away from inappropriate material.

As advanced as YouTube is, I still get random videos appearing in the suggestions pane on the home page. Some I would never watch in a million years and others are so low quality that I don’t know why anyone would watch them. The suggestions algorithm seems to take any search term used either on YouTube or Google and considers that fair game for my watching habits. Not cool. Good job you can stop them.

If you want to make use of the millions of child-friendly videos on the network but want to be confident that your little ones will not be exposed to unsuitable materials, you will also need to know how to block videos on YouTube.


## Block videos on YouTube

There are a couple of ways of stopping the same annoying suggested videos appearing on your YouTube page.

The first is to clear and pause your viewing history. This stops the YouTube suggestions algorithm using your habits to offer suggestions. If you are constantly shown the same suggestions again and again even when you tell it you’re not interested, this should stop it. However, it will also cause YouTube to randomize your suggestions.

* Log into YouTube and select History.
* Select Clear all watch history and confirm.
* Select Pause watch history and confirm.


**Once you clear your history and pause it, using the ‘not interested’ option seems to be much more effective.**


* Navigate to the YouTube home page to see your suggestions. They should now be randomized.
* Select the three tiny dots under one of the videos and select not interested.
* If you want to get rid of the entire channel, select the gray ‘X’ at the end of the row.
